# Eric Readme
Inspired by [other managers](https://hackernoon.com/12-manager-readmes-from-silicon-valleys-top-tech-companies-26588a660afe), I have my own readme which outlines what I believe, how I operate, what's important to me, etc. I have shared this with all the teams that I have worked with. It may sound great from paper and it's easier said than done, and let's work together to build relationships and trust.

## My Goal
Offer my best and help, wherever I can, successful delivery of the team’s mission and achieve individuals success

## How?
I am
- Not native English speaker. Let me know if you cannot understand me because I may speak too fast:)
- People First.
    - You are not my direct report but direct support.
    - Your success is my success. My success comes through helping others succeed. I commit to understanding you so that you could happily work at your nature best, unleash &amp; achieve your potential, make the team better than they already are i.e. through regular 1:1s focusing on your career progressing, etc
    - I am vulnerable with you. It is alright.
        - I don’t know all the answers and I will ask for help.
        - I made mistakes and I will own them.
        - I have a personality and preference, and I am still learning.
        - All learning starts with “I don’t know” and then figures it out.
    - Failures are inevitable and ask why and what caused the failures and how could we bring better tools and information and context accessible to improve and prevent it from happening again
        - https://www.ryn.works/blog/2017/06/17/on-failure-and-resilience focus on desired outcome and how people can work together to help resolve a situation in the moment as well as make the systems involved better equipped to handle situations in the future, can do wonders for system and organizational resilience.
    - I like to be challenged and I do not feel offended. Ideas don’t get better with agreement. I will keep asking feedback on my performance which is critical to my success
        - I will respectfully challenge decisions when I disagree and I seek diverse perspectives
        - I seek discussion, not consensus
    - If you think about planning to leave and join a new company, let’s have a chat if you trust me and explore what options are to help you. I have a personal lesson to share with you if you like to hear.
- Passionate on building an Effective & Productive Team. I am committed and passionate to create an engaged, safe, empowered, recognition-rich, Agile (tight feedback loop), continuous improved and collaborative environment and being a servant leader.
- Have gig mindset - self-manage, take initiatives, focus on skills more than roles, shortcut processes, and don’t hesitate to question the status quo
- Bias to making progress towards goals &amp; delivering customer value. I believe starting is the best way to begin learning and make progress, i.e. big fan of CI/CD, automation, monitoring/alerting, etc.
    - I won't checkin for progress update and will wait for an update in next standup unless it is a high priority of the day, i.e. incident resolution, unblocking others, etc
        - Let me know if you are blocked and how I can help
    - My role is to make priorities and goals/outcomes super clear and transparent to you, and ensure we are making progress towards achieving it.
    - Experiment &amp; Feedback over Opinion (There is no right or wrong answer, let’s experiment and get feedback)
- My favourite book, Turn The Ship Around and my leadership style is influenced by it
    - Leader-Leader model, instead of Leader-Follower model https://www.slideshare.net/micrimson/turn-the-ship-around-041614 and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psAXMqxwol8 and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivwKQqf4ixA and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzJL8zX3EVk
- My expectation of you &amp; myself
    - This is your team, not just mine. Be a giver not taker. Constructively challenge the status quo, look for better ways to do things and passionately advocate continuous improvement
        - Don’t let roles get in the way, participate &amp; ask questions around business analysis, UX, development, etc
        - Giver culture https://youtu.be/YyXRYgjQXX0
            - Success is really more about contribution
            - Help other people succeed
            - Encourage help-seeking. Make help-seeking a norm where people ask a lot. Asking is not embracing, vulnerable but encouraged
    - A team player which means we only win if we all win. No egos and heroes. It is not about being a hero but jumping in and contributing to the successful delivery of the team’s mission
        - **We success and fail as a team instead of individuals**
        - Don't expect you to be an expert in everything (otherwise the cognitive load would be too much for individuals), but be curious and willing to do more than just your own thing and [work side-by-side, in a give and take, with others](https://github.com/EricJWHuang/leadership-private/blob/main/collaborative-and-self-contained.md). For example, while others are responsible and have expertise in their domains i.e. business analysis, programming, testing, operation, support, etc, you could propose ideas, offer feedback to requirements, pair with other engineers i.e. pair programming, adding tests, etc, set up monitoring dashboard and alerts, etc
    - **A thinker not an order taker**. Be autonomous &amp; self-managing (I will share as much as I can on goals & context & problems & why)
        - I will try to be last to speak and express my opinions so that you could think and feel contribution
    - Ownership. You build it, you run it
    - Let me know what you need from me to be successful in your role
