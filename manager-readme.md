# Eric Readme
Inspired by [other managers](https://hackernoon.com/12-manager-readmes-from-silicon-valleys-top-tech-companies-26588a660afe), I have my own readme which outlines what I believe, how I operate, what's important to me, etc. I have shared this with all the teams that I have worked with. It may sound great from paper and it's easier said than done, and let's work together to build relationships and trust.

## My Goal
Offer my best and help, wherever I can, successful delivery of the team’s mission and achieve individuals success

## My Guilding Principles
- Put People First
    - You are not my direct report but direct support. You don't work for me, I work for you
    - Your success is my success. My success comes through helping others succeed. I commit to understanding you so that you could happily work at your nature best, unleash &amp; achieve your potential, make the team better than they already are i.e. through regular 1:1s focusing on your career progressing, etc
- Promote Effective & Productive Team environment
    - I am committed and passionate to create an engaged, safe, empowered, recognition-rich, Agile (tight feedback loop), continuous improved and collaborative environment and being a servant leader.
    - Help you become [an empowered engineer](https://svpg.com/the-most-important-thing/)

## How I Operate
- I am not a native English speaker. Let me know if you cannot understand me i.e. I may speak too fast occasionally :)
- I come to work driven to succeed, to grow, and to be acknowledged.
- I am vulnerable with you. It is alright.
    - I don’t know all the answers and I will ask for help.
    - I made mistakes and I will own them.
        - Failures are inevitable and ask why and what caused the failures and how could we bring better tools and information and context accessible to improve and prevent it from happening again
            - https://www.ryn.works/blog/2017/06/17/on-failure-and-resilience focus on desired outcome and how people can work together to help resolve a situation in the moment as well as make the systems involved better equipped to handle situations in the future, can do wonders for system and organizational resilience.
    - I have a personality and preference, and I am still learning.
    - All learning starts with “I don’t know” and then figures it out.
- I like to be challenged and I do not feel offended. Ideas don’t get better with agreement. I will keep asking feedback on my performance which is critical to my success
    - I will respectfully challenge decisions when I disagree and I seek diverse perspectives
    - I seek discussion, not consensus
- I have gig mindset - self-manage, take initiatives, focus on skills more than roles, shortcut processes, and don’t hesitate to question the status quo
- I am bias to making progress towards goals &amp; delivering customer value. I believe starting is the best way to begin learning and make progress, i.e. MVP, CI/CD, automation, monitoring/alerting, etc.
    - I would limit WIP
    - I would like to explore different options to deliver outcome as efficiently as possible i.e. getting stuff done in parallel, MVP, etc
    - I won't checkin for progress update and will wait for an update in next standup **unless** it is a high priority of the day, i.e. high serv incident resolution, unblocking others, etc
        - Let me know if you are blocked and how I can help
        - I love Pub/Sub instead of polling communication model
    - I would like to have a call together if there seems a misalignment on priority
    - My role is to make priorities and goals/outcomes super clear and transparent to you, and ensure we are making progress towards achieving it.
    - Experiment &amp; Feedback over Opinion (There is no right or wrong answer, let’s experiment and get feedback)
- My favourite book, Turn The Ship Around and my leadership style is influenced by it
    - Leader-Leader model, instead of Leader-Follower model https://www.slideshare.net/micrimson/turn-the-ship-around-041614 and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psAXMqxwol8 and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivwKQqf4ixA and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzJL8zX3EVk

## My expectation of you &amp; myself
- This is your team, not just mine. Be a giver not taker. Constructively challenge the status quo, look for better ways to do things and passionately advocate continuous improvement
    - Don’t let roles or title get in the way, participate &amp; ask questions around business analysis, UX, development, etc
    - Giver culture https://youtu.be/YyXRYgjQXX0
        - Success is really more about contribution
        - Help other people succeed
        - Encourage help-seeking. Make help-seeking a norm where people ask a lot. Asking is not embracing, vulnerable but encouraged
    - Our job as engineers is to solve customer and business problems.
- A team player which means we only win if we all win. No egos and heroes. It is not about being a hero but jumping in and contributing to the successful delivery of the team’s mission
    - **We success and fail as a team instead of individuals**
    - Stakeholder management. Collaborate with team on your plan of attack, design, etc to get buy-ins and feedback
    - Don't expect you to be an expert in everything and perform any kind of task (otherwise the cognitive load would be too much for individuals), but be curious and willing to learn and do more than just your own thing and [work side-by-side, in a give and take, with others](https://github.com/EricJWHuang/leadership-private/blob/main/collaborative-and-self-contained.md) where we **combine different skills in the most effective way, not hand-off or throw stuff over the fence**. For example, while others are responsible and have expertise in their domains i.e. business analysis, programming, testing, operation, support, etc, you could propose ideas, offer feedback to requirements, pair with other engineers i.e. pair programming, adding tests, learn new programming language, etc, set up monitoring dashboard and alerts, etc
        - Regularly i.e. every other sprint, share knowledge with others and try to complete at least one task you’ve never done before to avoid knowledge silos
- **A collaborative thinker not an order taker**. Be autonomous &amp; self-managing &amp; collaborative (I will share as much as I can on goals & context & problems & why)
    - I will try to be last to speak and express my opinions so that you could think and feel contribution
    - I believe this will be "unlocking people’s potential to maximize their own performance"
    - Lean & Try & Fail Fast. Take risks in safe ways
    - Keep decision making visible and socialise it with others to collaborate
- Ownership (you build it, you run it)
- Humble (taking oneself not so important, being able to put other's first)
- Hungry (wanting to contribute, to the purpose of the team, the product, firm)
- Smart (people-smart, common knowledge and self-awareness of how and how not to treat other people.)
- Ability to learn (we may hire you for a certain set of skills, the rate of change and the need for skills is quite rapid)
- Connect to co-workers
- Let me know what you need from me to be successful in your role
